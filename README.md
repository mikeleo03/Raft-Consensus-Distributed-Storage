# About The Project
This project is a distributed key-value in-memory storage system that offers several core functionalities and ensures consistency and availability within a cluster. The system is implemented using Python, Flask, NodeJS, and React. The system is based on the Raft consensus protocol, which is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It allows a collection of machines to work as a single coherent group that can survive the failures of some of its members.

# Features
## Core Services
| Service | Description | Command | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ping | Check connection with the server | `ping` | `PONG` |
| Get | Retrieve value associated with a key | `get <key>` | `"value"` |
| Set | Set a value for a key | `set <key> <value>` | `OK` |
| Strln | Retrieve length of value associated with a key | `strln <key>` | `<length>` |
| Del | Delete entry associated with a key | `del <key>` | `"value"` |
| Append | Append a value to the existing value of a key | `append <key> <value>` | `OK` |
| Request Log | Request log entries from node | `request_log` | `log_entries` |

## Distributed System Features
| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Membership Change | Mechanism to add and remove server nodes dynamically |
| Log Replication | Cluster action logging system to replicate logs across nodes for consistency |
| Heartbeat | Periodic messages to monitor node health and maintain connections |
| Leader Election | Mechanism for leader node failover to ensure high availability and fault tolerance |

   ```
2. Start Server nodes
   ```bash
   # Leader node
   python3 server.py <ip> <port>
   # Follower node
   python3 server.py <ip> <port> <leader_ip> <leader_port>
   ```
3. Start Client
   ```bash
   python3 Client.py <ip> <port>
   ```
